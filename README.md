# Hand-written-digit-recognition

Handwritten digit recognition using MNIST dataset is a standard project made with the help of Neural Network. It basically detects the scanned images of handwritten digits. 

A neural network is a model inspired by how the brain works. It consists of multiple layers having many activations, this activation resembles neurons of our brain. A neural network tries to learn a set of parameters in a set of data which could help to recognize the underlying relationships. Neural networks can adapt to changing input; so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria.
